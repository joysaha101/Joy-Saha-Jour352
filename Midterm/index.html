    <p>Before the final whistle, before the chants of “Equal pay!” ricocheted around Stade de Lyon, before Megan Rapinoe’s
      arms were filled with all the trophies a soccer player could possibly earn in one year, first came the tears.<br><br></p>

    <p>On July 7, in the 61st minute of the 2019 World Cup final against the Netherlands, Rapinoe scored to put the U.S. up 1–0.
      To her, though, this was more than the goal that would win the Americans a record fourth title.
      It was the equivalent of flashing double-barrel middle fingers. She’d have loved to have done that just once.
      But, she says, “there are lines.”<br><br></p>

    <p>The goal itself, on a penalty kick drawn by teammate Alex Morgan, was, like Rapinoe, more about brains than brawn.
      She reminded herself, Your opponent is more nervous than you are, then she went low and a bit right, breaking her tendency of high and left.
      Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal flinched toward Rapinoe’s usual side, the net rippled, teammates swarmed and the whole scene ended with
      the pink-haired lesbian winger posing near the corner flag in defiance and triumph and joy:
      arms outstretched, chin up, head tipped just back.<br><br></p>
